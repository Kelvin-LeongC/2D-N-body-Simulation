# 2D-N-body-Simulation

A simple programme to visualize N bodies dynamical system written in Java. The alogrithm used is Direct Calculation (O(n^2)) time complexity) with Forward Euler's Method (1st-order method, not very accurate)

This project is inspired by the Three-body-problem-Simulator https://evgenii.com/blog/three-body-problem-simulator/, with the intention of making the simulation with more flexibility
